1.  Introduction

   The primary goal of the SSL protocol is to provide privacy and
   reliability between two communicating applications.  The protocol is
   composed of two layers.  At the lowest level, layered on top of some
   reliable transport protocol (e.g., TCP [RFC0793]), is the SSL record
   protocol.  The SSL record protocol is used for encapsulation of
   various higher level protocols.  One such encapsulated protocol, the
   SSL handshake protocol, allows the server and client to authenticate
   each other and to negotiate an encryption algorithm and cryptographic
   keys before the application protocol transmits or receives its first
   byte of data.  One advantage of SSL is that it is application
   protocol independent.  A higher level protocol can layer on top of
   the SSL protocol transparently.  The SSL protocol provides connection
   security that has three basic properties:

   o  The connection is private.  Encryption is used after an initial
      handshake to define a secret key.  Symmetric cryptography is used
      for data encryption (e.g., DES [DES], 3DES [3DES], RC4 [SCH]).

   o  The peer's identity can be authenticated using asymmetric, or
      public key, cryptography (e.g., RSA [RSA], DSS [DSS]).

   o  The connection is reliable.  Message transport includes a message
      integrity check using a keyed Message Authentication Code (MAC)
      [RFC2104].  Secure hash functions (e.g., SHA, MD5) are used for
      MAC computations.
